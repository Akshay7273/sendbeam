/**
 * Resume preamble (V13-PR08): the product integration of the reviewed PR07 resume-auth
 * engine. The TypeScript twin of `packages/wire/resume_preamble.go`.
 *
 * It runs the transport-agnostic mutual-authentication handshake over the sealed session
 * channel — strictly BEFORE the transfer engine starts — so durable progress from a previous
 * authenticated session is never reused under session keys, and no
 * Manifest/ResumeState/BlockData/Complete frame can flow before the peers authenticated
 * continuity with each other.
 *
 * The resume-auth messages travel as FrameResumeAuth frames sealed under the SESSION
 * directional keys (the keys the SPAKE2 handshake just derived): the session key epoch is
 * used ONLY to carry the four resume-auth messages, and the transfer itself runs under the
 * FRESH key epoch derived from the mutually authenticated resume master (ADR 0005 §7). The
 * PR07 engine is unchanged: transferId + manifest fingerprint + role + resume secret are
 * local context (never transmitted), the transcript binds them, and the fresh nonces make
 * every attempt a new key epoch.
 *
 * Fail-closed rules: any inbound frame that is not a well-formed resume-auth frame (wrong
 * type, wrong counter, torn, tampered, oversized, malformed) settles the preamble failed
 * before the transfer could start. An exact duplicate of the last accepted frame (a
 * transport-level re-send with the same counter) is re-opened and re-answered idempotently
 * from the engine's snapshots — never with a fresh nonce or proof. There is no challenge
 * replacement, no nonce/proof/role/version mutation, and no unbounded history.
