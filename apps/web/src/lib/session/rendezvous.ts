/**
 * Browser rendezvous orchestrator — the seam between the transport and the pure handshake
 * state machine. It owns a {@link SignalingClient} and a {@link RendezvousSession}, wiring
 * the socket's inbound frames into `session.handle` and the session's outbound sink into
 * `client.send`, then drives the lifecycle: connect (with backoff) → `start` → resolve with
 * the session keys, or fail closed.
 *
 * The two layers below it stay ignorant of each other — the state machine never touches a
 * `WebSocket`, and the client never parses a handshake. This module is the only place that
 * knows both, which keeps each unit-testable and gives the Svelte UI a single object to
 * bind against: a live `phase`, the invite `code` once allocated, and a `done` promise.
 *
 * A socket drop after opening is mapped to a session `abort`, so the UI observes exactly
 * one terminal outcome (`done` rejects) whether the failure came from the peer, the crypto,
 * or the wire.
