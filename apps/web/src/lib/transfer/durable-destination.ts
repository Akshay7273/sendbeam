/**
 * Browser durable receive destination (V13-PR03) — the browser twin of the CLI's
 * DurableDestination (apps/cli/internal/transfer/durable.go). It runs inside the transfer
 * worker so it can use `FileSystemSyncAccessHandle` where supported; verified blocks land in
 * OPFS partials, each checkpoint advances only after the data is flushed, and the journal
 * (IndexedDB) is the single source of resumable progress.
 *
 * Durability ordering (ADR 0004): verify (wire layer) → write → flush → atomic journal
 * checkpoint → the wire ack. `Sink.write` resolves only after write+flush+commit, so the
 * receiver's ack always follows a committed checkpoint.
 *
 * The async fallback (browsers without sync access handles) is honest about its limits: the
 * stream can only be flushed at close, so a file's checkpoint advances only after its whole
 * stream is closed — never block-by-block.
